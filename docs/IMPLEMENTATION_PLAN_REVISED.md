  - [ ] Blob extraction
  - [X] Performance testing

- [ ] Binary Content Handling
  - [ ] Image extraction
  - [ ] Metadata parsing
  - [ ] Efficient caching
  - [X] Memory usage monitoring

## Phase 2: Storage & Navigation (Week 3-4)

### Week 3: Data Layer
- [ ] Storage Layer (ZIM-Optimized)
  - [ ] Remove current DB placeholders
  - [ ] Design ZIM-specific schema
  - [ ] Implement cluster caching
  - [ ] Add integrity checking

- [ ] Article Processing
  - [ ] Remove web-centric parser
  - [ ] Implement ZIM article handler
  - [ ] Add internal link resolution
  - [ ] Create navigation index

### Week 4: Search & Access
- [ ] Search Implementation
  - [ ] Title index
  - [ ] Full-text search design
  - [ ] Quick navigation paths
  - [ ] Search result caching

- [ ] Download Manager (Completion)
  - [ ] Finish resume capability
  - [ ] Add integrity verification
  - [ ] Implement storage management
  - [ ] Add download recovery

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Mandatory)
- Test each component in isolation
- Focus on ZIM format specifics
- Include error cases
- Measure performance

### Integration Tests
- Component interaction
- Full article retrieval flow
- Search functionality
- Download resumption

### Performance Tests
- Memory usage under load
- Search response times
- Content extraction speed
- Storage efficiency

## Success Metrics

### Core Functionality
- ZIM parsing accuracy
- Content extraction reliability
- Navigation responsiveness
- Search precision

### Performance Targets
- Article load < 500ms
- Memory use < 100MB
- Search results < 200ms
- Smooth scrolling

## Development Rules

1. No Placeholder Code
   - Remove current placeholders
   - Implement or leave empty
   - Document missing pieces
   - Track in issue system

2. Test First Development
   - Write tests before code
   - Include performance tests
   - Test with real ZIM files
   - Verify memory usage

3. Documentation Requirements
   - Document ZIM format details
   - Explain implementation choices
   - Include performance notes
   - Add debugging guides

4. Review Points
   - Code review each component
   - Performance review
   - Memory usage check
   - Test coverage verification

## Current State Assessment

### Working
- [X] Header reading
- [X] Basic file operations
- [X] Initial project structure

### Needs Replacement
- [ ] Article parser (wrong assumptions)
- [ ] Database service (placeholder)
- [ ] Storage system (incomplete)

### Not Started
- [ ] Directory parsing
- [ ] Cluster handling
- [ ] Content extraction
- [ ] Search system

## Next Steps

1. Remove Placeholder Code
   - Delete web-centric article parser
   - Remove incomplete database service
   - Clear out dummy implementations

2. Implement Core ZIM
   - Complete directory entry parsing
   - Add cluster management
   - Create content extractor
   - Build search indexer

3. Add Storage Layer
   - Design proper schema
   - Implement caching
   - Add integrity checks
   - Create backup system

4. Build Search System
   - Create title index
   - Add content search
   - Implement quick nav
   - Add search cache

## Note on Future Features

- Knowledge graph deferred
- Social features on hold
- Focus on core reading
- Build solid foundation

Remember: No more placeholder implementations. Either fully implement a feature or leave it clearly marked as not implemented.
