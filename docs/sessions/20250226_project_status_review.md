# Project Status Review - February 26, 2025

## Overview

Completed comprehensive review of project status, revealing discrepancies between reported and actual implementation state.

## Key Findings

### Implementation Status

#### Completed Components
- Base file structure handling
  - Header parsing
  - Magic number validation
  - UUID management
  - Basic file operations
- Download system
  - Resumable downloads
  - Hash verification
  - Queue management
  - Progress tracking
  - State persistence

#### Partially Complete
- Directory Entries
  - Basic structure implemented ✓
  - MIME type handling ✓
  - Namespace management ✓
  - Complete parsing needed ✗
  - Efficient loading needed ✗
- Search
  - Title-based search ✓
  - URL lookups ✓
  - Entry type filtering ✓
  - Full text search needed ✗
- Cluster Management
  - Header parsing ✓
  - Blob boundaries ✓
  - Offset management ✓
  - LZMA integration needed ✗
  - Caching needed ✗

#### Not Started
- LZMA Support (Critical Blocker)
- Content Processing
- Caching System
- Full-text Search
- Advanced Features

### Critical Blockers

1. LZMA2 Decompression
   - Core functionality blocked
   - Placeholder implementation only
   - Required for content access

2. Directory Entry Parsing
   - Current implementation incomplete
   - Needs efficiency improvements
   - Blocking content organization

3. Cluster Management
   - Basic structure exists
   - Blocked by LZMA implementation
   - Caching system needed

4. Content Extraction
   - Cannot proceed without LZMA
   - Web-centric assumptions need revision
   - Image handling not implemented

## Timeline Assessment

Currently in Week 1 of 4-week implementation plan:
- Some Week 1 tasks complete (header reading, basic file ops)
- Behind schedule on directory entry parsing
- LZMA implementation blocking progress
- Need to remove placeholder implementations

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. Core ZIM Support
   - Complete directory entry parsing
   - Implement LZMA2 decompression
   - Build proper cluster management
   - Remove web-centric placeholders

2. Content Processing
   - Implement content extraction
   - Add proper image handling
   - Build cluster caching
   - Create ZIM-specific article parser

## Technical Debt

1. Placeholder Implementations
   - LZMA decompression
   - Cluster management
   - Content extraction
   - Need proper implementations

2. Architectural Issues
   - Web-centric article parser
   - Inefficient image handling
   - Missing caching layer

## Notes

- Download system is more complete than initially documented
- Several components marked complete were partially implemented
- Need to focus on core ZIM functionality before advanced features
- Testing coverage needs expansion
