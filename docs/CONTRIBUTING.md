# Contributing to Robinpedia

**Note: This project is currently in a private development phase as part of personal re-establishment efforts. While we intend to open source this project in the future, we are not accepting external contributions at this time.**

## Future Open Source Plans

This project is intended to be open-sourced once the initial development phase is complete and personal circumstances allow. When that happens, this document will be updated with comprehensive contribution guidelines.

## Project Vision Alignment

This project aligns with our overarching vision of creating accessible, maintainable, and user-centric knowledge management systems. When we open source this project, we will welcome contributions that:

2. Improve system reliability and performance
3. Add features that align with our core mission
4. Fix bugs and improve code quality
5. Enhance documentation and testing

## Current Development

## Documentation

All contributions must maintain or improve our documentation standards, including:
- Updating relevant documentation files

## Version Control

We follow a structured commit message format and maintain a clean git history. All changes must be:
