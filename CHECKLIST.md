# Robinpedia Development Checklist

## Current Sprint (February 2025)
Target Completion: March 15, 2025

### Core ZIM Format Implementation
- [/] ZIM Parser
  - [X] Header reading and validation
  - [ ] Directory entry parsing (not started)
  - [ ] MIME type handling (not started)
  - [ ] URL/Title index building (not started)
  - [ ] Cluster pointer management (not started)

### Content Extraction
- [ ] Cluster Management
  - [ ] LZMA decompression (not started)
  - [ ] Content type detection (not started)
  - [ ] Memory-efficient reading (not started)
  - [ ] Cache management (not started)

### Article Processing
- [/] Content Parser
  - [ ] Binary content handling (not started)
  - [ ] ZIM-specific HTML processing (current implementation assumes web content)
  - [ ] Internal image extraction (current implementation assumes external URLs)
  - [ ] ZIM-specific link handling (not started)

### Download System
- [/] Download Manager
  - [X] Basic file operations
  - [/] Resume capability (partially implemented)
  - [/] Progress tracking (basic implementation)
  - [ ] Storage optimization (not started)
  - [ ] Integrity verification (placeholder implementation)

### Storage Layer
- [/] Database Implementation
  - [ ] Schema definition (not started)
  - [ ] Article storage (placeholder implementation)
  - [ ] Search indexing (placeholder implementation)
  - [ ] Offline queue (placeholder implementation)

### Search System
- [ ] Search Implementation
  - [ ] Title indexing (not started)
  - [ ] Content indexing (not started)
  - [ ] Link graph (not started)
  - [ ] Quick navigation (not started)

### Next Actions (Prioritized)
1. Complete directory entry parsing in ZimParser
2. Implement cluster decompression
3. Create proper article content extractor
4. Build ZIM-specific link processor
5. Implement storage schema
6. Add basic search functionality

## Testing Coverage
- [X] Header reading tests
- [ ] Directory parsing tests (not started)
- [ ] Content extraction tests (not started)
- [ ] Link processing tests (not started)
- [ ] Download resume tests (not started)
- [ ] Storage tests (not started)

## Performance Goals
- [ ] Memory-efficient reading (not implemented)
- [ ] Fast article access (not implemented)
- [ ] Quick search results (not implemented)
- [ ] Smooth navigation (not implemented)

## Notes
- Current implementation has significant placeholder code
- Several components need complete rewrite for ZIM format
- Database schema needs proper design
- Search system needs ZIM-specific implementation
- Most "completed" components are basic implementations only

## Status Legend
- [ ] Not started
- [/] In progress (partial implementation)
- [X] Completed and tested

## Warning Areas
1. ArticleManager assumes web-like content structure
2. ArticleParser downloads external images (wrong approach)
3. DatabaseService has placeholder implementation
4. Search indexing not designed for ZIM format
5. Download manager needs proper resume handling
6. No proper error handling for ZIM format errors
